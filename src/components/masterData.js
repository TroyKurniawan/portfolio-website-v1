I've always been interested in all things tech, whether it be tinkering with video game consoles, or building a PC. I was eventually introduced to web development in university, where I would make webapps for classes and student clubs. After a break, I've now reignited my passion for webdev, looking to explore everything it has to offer and what's to come next. In my spare time, I like to write music, DJ, draw, and catch Pokémon.",
